# Expanding-Cards--Project1
 This is the first project in the 50 projects in 50 days on Udemy. This project has mobile responsiveness.
 I have made some minor (curious) changes to the original code the course instructor used in the solution, but there is always room for improvement.
 
 # What I Gained from this Project
 I refreshed my HTML skills and learnt some new CSS tips (for instance, the use of :nth-of-type() to hide some of the cards in the medai query section)
 I also got to refresh my Javascript skills using forEach(), functions, addEventListner()
 
 # Areas I Need to Work on More
 I have more to learn in CSS (for example, the intricacies of 'transition') and Javascript(how to problem solve more when given tasks)
