# Expanding-Cards--Project1
 This is the first project in the 50 projects in 50 days on Udemy.
 I have made some minor (curious) changes to the original code the course instructor used in the solution
 
 #WHAT I GAINED FROM THIS PROJECT
 I refreshed my HTML skills and learnt some new CSS tips (for instance, the use of :nth-of-type() to hide some of the cards in the medai query section)
 I also got to refresh my Jacascript skills using forEach(), functions, addEventListner()
